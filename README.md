# DSA-D3-Assignment
Objective: Implement an algorithm to count the number of prime numbers in an integer array.



Background: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 
For example, 5 is prime because the only ways to write it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.



Input: arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Output: 4

Explanation: The prime numbers in the array are [2, 3, 5, 7].
